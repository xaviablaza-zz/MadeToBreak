MadeToBreak is a plugin designed for Bukkit servers. It replicates the idea of planned obsolescence
for different appliances in Minecraft.

This plugin has a configurable limit on how many times you can open a furnace or crafting bench (and soon, enchantment table)
Once that amount of uses are exhausted, the appliance becomes broken and can be set to do the following:
- Explode with or without environmental damage
- Disappear
- Display a message to the user on right click (if not set to explode or disappear after its final use)

This forces players on the server to constantly create new appliances, thus making them
always use resources to create these blocks unlike vanilla Minecraft.
